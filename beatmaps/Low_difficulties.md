# Low difficulties
Low difficulties are where any newbie should start, these difficulties usually go ["Easy, Normal, Hard"] although other difficulty names for these types do exist. (Easy, Light-Advanced, Advanced or Normal). Typically, the star rating pattern for these difficulties are pretty straightforward:
* 0.0*-1.99* = Easy
* 2.0*-2.69* = Normal
* 2.7*-3.99* = Hard

However, it can be inaccurate to base difficulty names off of Star Rating. An accurate example of this is when a Hard difficulty is 4* when it does not fly close to a Insane difficulity. An inaccurate example is this is when a so-called Hard difficulty is 3* however is AR9.2, OD.8.9, has 1/9 jumps and streams and is not passable for a player that doesn't have a decent amount of skill (e.g Newcomers). At that point you should know that's not your typical Hard difficulty. As pointed out, these are the difficulites that any player looking for improvement and all that should start with.
