# Low difficulties
Low difficulties are where any newbie should start; these difficulties usually go ["Easy, Normal, Hard"], although other difficulty names for these types do exist. (Easy, Light, Light Advanced, Advanced, or Normal). Typically, the star rating pattern for these difficulties is pretty straightforward:
* 0.0*-1.99* = Easy
* 2.0*-2.69* = Normal
* 2.7*-3.99* = Hard

(source: <https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Beatmap/Star_rating>)

However, it can be inaccurate to base difficulty names off of star rating. An example of this is when a Hard difficulty is 4.2 star when it does not fly close to an insane difficulty. An example is this is when a so-called Hard difficulty is 3*; however, AR9.2, OD.8.9, has full 1/4s (streams) and is not passable for a player that doesn't have a decent amount of skill (e.g., newcomers). At that point, you should know that's not your typical Hard difficulty. As pointed out, these are the difficulties that any player looking for improvement should start with.
