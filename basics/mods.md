# Mods
* Not to be confused with the [Global Moderation Team](roles/GMT.md) or [Beatmap Modding](Beatmapping/modding.md)

Mods, short for Modifcations are to modify gameplay to a extent of being more challenging or less in exchange for unranked gameplay, higher score, more or less performance points, etc. Below are a WIP-list of mods:
## Easy
1. EZ (Easy) - for osu!standard the current [CS](Gameplay/Circle_Size.md), [OD](Gameplay/Overall_Difficulty.md), [HP](Beatmapping/options#Health.md), and [AR](Gameplay/Approach_Rate.md) values are lowered.
### Benefits of Easy:
Pro: Players are given 3 lives with said mod.

Con: Despite the name, this mod can lead to unreadable moments and in some cases, the name, "Easy" can be misleading for some maps.

Con: [Medals](Gameplay/Medals.md) that require you to pass a map without any score reduction mods are unavailable. There are medals that can be awarded with Easy. ([See haitai.jp](http://haitai.jp/))
## No-Fail
1. NF (No-Fail) - for all modes will prevent players from failing a map.

### Benefits of No-Fail:
Pro: Failure is practically non-existant.

Con: [Medals](Gameplay/Medals.md) that require you to pass a map without any score reduction mods are unavailable. There are medals that can be awarded with No-Fail. ([See haitai.jp](http://haitai.jp/)).
