# Mods

* Not to be confused with the [Global Moderation Team](roles/GMT.md) or [Beatmap Modding](Beatmapping/modding.md).

Mods, short for Modifications are to modify gameplay to the extent of being more challenging or less in exchange for unranked gameplay, a higher score, more or less performance points, etc. Below is a list of mods:

## Easy

1. EZ (Easy): for osu!standard the current [CS](Gameplay/Circle_Size.md), [OD](Gameplay/Overall_Difficulty.md), [HP](Beatmapping/options#Health.md), and [AR](Gameplay/Approach_Rate.md) values are lowered.

### Benefits of Easy

Pro: players are given 3 lives with said mod.

Con: despite the name, this mod can lead to unreadable moments and in some cases, the name, "Easy" can be misleading for some maps.

Con: [Medals](Gameplay/Medals.md) that require you to pass a map without any score reduction mods are unavailable. There are medals that can be awarded with Easy. ([See haitai.jp](http://haitai.jp/))

## No-Fail

1. NF (No-Fail): prevents players from failing a map.

### Benefits of No-Fail

Pro: Failure is practically nonexistent.

Con: [Medals](Gameplay/Medals.md) that require you to pass a map without any score reduction mods are unavailable. There are medals that can be awarded with No-Fail. ([See haitai.jp](http://haitai.jp/)).

## Half-Time

1. HT (Half-Time): slows down the selected map by 0.75. (source: https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Beatmap/Star_rating)

### Benefits of Half-Time
